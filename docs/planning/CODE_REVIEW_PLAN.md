Suggested “deep-dive” workflow

1. Spin up a fresh o3 (or any AI reviewer).  
2. Feed it the high-level docs first  
   – `frontend/src/ARCHITECTURE.md`  
   – `docs/API_Documentation_Workflow.md`  
   – The JSDoc-rich files we just refined (`PortfolioRepository`, `PortfolioCacheService`, `portfolioStore`).

3. Give it a focused checklist to review:  
   • Provider hierarchy / data flow (App → QueryProvider → …).  
   • Store-repository-cache pipeline.  
   • Hook → Manager → Service call pattern.  
   • Error handling & logging strategy.  
   • Spots where documentation is still “TODO: elaborate”.

4. As it reviews each area, have it:  
   • Confirm the code matches the documentation.  
   • Point out ambiguities or missing diagrams.  
   • Suggest concise additions (class headers, sequence diagrams, README snippets).  
   • Open a small PR (or directly patch) for each doc gap rather than one giant rewrite.

5. When the reviewer finishes, run a final ESLint + `remark-validate-links` pass to ensure docs and code stay in sync.

This incremental “review + doc touch-up” loop will leave you with:

✓ Accurate, polished documentation you can hand to new devs.  
✓ A second set of eyes verifying no architectural edge-cases were missed.  
✓ A clean lint/test pipeline that blocks future drift.
