Excellent context — here’s what you’re describing:

You have a fully working frontend architecture, and a rich set of backend APIs (risk, optimization, scenarios, portfolios, CRUD, settings).

But the UI interface + hook wiring + intent triggering hasn’t been built for those backend functions yet.

⸻

🎯 Objective

You want to wire up user-triggered frontend functionality to your existing backend endpoints, via your current architecture (which includes: hooks, manager, repo, session provider, store, query cache, etc).

⸻

🧭 Recommended Plan: Systematic Interface Layering

We’ll do this in three passes:

⸻

Phase 1: Catalog the API Interfaces (source of truth)

Create a single flat map of:
	•	Endpoint: /api/risk/analyze
	•	Description: “Get risk decomposition for current portfolio”
	•	Method: POST
	•	Inputs: { portfolio_id, config? }
	•	Output: { volatility, beta, exposures, ... }

Do this for:
	•	Optimization functions
	•	Scenario engine
	•	Portfolio management (CRUD)
	•	Risk settings
	•	Any others

📄 Goal: This is your “API contract registry.” Treat it as the authoritative source when wiring front-end.

⸻

Phase 2: Hook + Manager + Repo wiring (no UI yet)

Now, for each API:

Layer	What to create
repo.ts	Add pure I/O function: fetchRiskAnalysis(portfolioId)
manager.ts	(If needed) orchestrate multi-step logic
hooks/useRisk.ts	Wrap in useQuery / useMutation hook
intentRegistry.ts	Map a future user action to a function call ("runRiskAnalysis" → useRisk().run())
queryKey.ts	Define standardized query keys (['riskScore', portfolioId])

📦 Deliverables:
	•	You can now run the flow from hook → repo → API, and invalidate caches downstream

✅ This unlocks testing via Storybook, buttons, or CLI scripts without having real UI built

⸻

Phase 3: Progressive UI Layering (Component Surface)

Do this per feature, starting with highest priority flows (e.g. risk view, optimization):

Task	Description
Add button or panel in UI	“Run Risk Analysis”, “Run Max Return Optimization”
Connect to hook	useRisk().runRiskAnalysis()
Wire UI state	isLoading, error, result rendering
Observe global state	From portfolioStore() or authStore()
Display result	Table, chart, JSON, whatever basic format first

📈 You can later refine the UX/format. First goal is end-to-end working flow.

⸻

🧠 How to Prioritize
	1.	Start with features that are fire-and-forget:
	•	runRiskAnalysis()
	•	optimizeMaxReturn()
	•	runScenarioChangeExposure({ delta: 0.5 })
	2.	Then move to CRUD flows with views:
	•	createPortfolio(), deletePortfolio(), switchPortfolio()
	•	These affect global state (currentPortfolioId)
	3.	Then add settings or config:
	•	Risk preferences, guardrails, user-specific values

⸻

📌 Summary of Execution Plan

Step	Goal
✅ Catalog APIs	Know what you’re wiring to
✅ Create hooks/managers	Add useRisk(), useOptimize(), useScenario()
✅ Wire query/mutation	Use useQuery or useMutation in hooks
✅ Add intent mapping	handleIntent("optimizeMaxReturn") etc
✅ Build basic UI surface	Minimal buttons to trigger flows
✅ Add cache invalidation	Let data auto-refresh on trigger


⸻

Let me know if you want:
	•	A starter useRiskAnalysis() hook scaffold
	•	A table template to organize the API-to-hook registry
	•	Or a batch wiring plan you can knock out in parallel (e.g. risk + optimize same structure)

You’re at the part where structure compounds — and it’ll get faster from here.

DESIGN BRIEF:

✅ Exactly. You’ve nailed it.

Let me rephrase and lock this in:

⸻

🧱 Final Mental Model

🔹 features/

This is your data & logic system — one folder per domain or API area.
Each domain encapsulates everything needed to work with that system’s data.

What’s inside a features/x/ folder?	Purpose
hooks/useX.ts	React-aware orchestration (query, mutation, cache)
repo/xRepo.ts	Pure API call layer
manager/xManager.ts (optional)	Orchestrates multi-step logic
types.ts	Domain-specific types/interfaces
ui/ (optional UI blocks for reuse)	Small presentational pieces tied to the domain

Think of features/ as:
“This is where everything I need to work with risk (or optimize, portfolio, etc.) lives — except the UI layout.”

⸻

🔹 pages/, containers/, components/

This is your UI layer — it builds views from feature logic.

Folder	Role
pages/	Top-level route views (DashboardPage.tsx, ScenarioPage.tsx)
containers/	Wire hooks → state → component props (RiskAnalysisContainer)
components/	Dumb, stateless UI (RiskCard, PortfolioDropdown, etc.)

Views are built using the logic exported by features/ — they don’t know anything about the repo or query cache directly.

⸻

🔹 Glue / Infra

Location	Purpose
intentRegistry.ts	Maps commands → feature hook triggers
router.tsx	Defines navigation flow
SessionServicesProvider.tsx	App context for services like api, manager
queryKeys.ts	Canonical key structure for TanStack

✅ Summary Sentence

features/ owns the logic for interacting with each API/data domain.
UI folders (pages/, containers/, components/) render that logic.

Let me know if you want a file structure README or CLI scaffold to enforce this structure as you build. You’re in the “system hardening” phase — and this model will scale clean.
