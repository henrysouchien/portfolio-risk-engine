1. **Hardcoded API Keys** - Default API keys present in production code
2. **Development Authentication Bypass** - Authentication can be bypassed in certain configurations  
3. **Environment Variable Exposure** - Multiple .env files with potential secret exposure

### HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES
1. **NPM Vulnerabilities** - 12 security vulnerabilities including 1 critical form-data vulnerability
2. **Database Query Patterns** - Some queries lack proper parameterization validation
3. **CORS Configuration** - Overly permissive CORS settings for development

## Architecture & Performance Analysis ‚úÖ

### Strengths
- **Excellent Caching Implementation**: TTLCache with proper bounds (maxsize=1000, 30min TTL)
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Proper locking mechanisms in place
- **Clean Service Layer Separation**: Well-architected modular design
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error management framework
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging and operation tracking

### Caching System Assessment
The caching implementation in `services/portfolio/context_service.py` is **well-designed**:
```python
self.context_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=1800)  # 30-minute TTL, 1000 entries
```
- ‚úÖ **Bounded size** (1000 entries maximum)

## Configuration & Environment Security

### Issues Found
- Multiple `.env` files with varying configurations across environments
- Hardcoded settings in `settings.py` for portfolio defaults
- Some development secrets potentially exposed in version control
- Inconsistent environment variable validation

### Positive Findings
- Proper environment file structure with examples
- Good separation of development and production configurations
- Comprehensive logging configuration management
