# AI DEBUG MODE PROMPT

## DEBUGGING MODE ACTIVATION PROMPT

**"We're entering DEBUG MODE. Follow debugging principles:**

**1. FIND ROOT CAUSE FIRST - trace code paths, data flows, state changes systematically**
**2. ASK PERMISSION before expanding scope beyond the stated problem** 
**3. SURGICAL PRECISION - change only what's broken, preserve everything else**
**4. ONE STEP AT A TIME - verify each change works before continuing**
**5. SOLVE THE STATED PROBLEM EXACTLY - no creative additions or improvements**

**The problem is: [specific issue]**

**Your job: Find WHY this happens, then fix ONLY that root cause. No scope expansion without permission."**

---

## DEBUGGING PRINCIPLES (DETAILED)

### PRINCIPLE 1: ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION WITH SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
- **Find WHY the problem exists before fixing HOW to stop it**
- **Use systematic investigation: trace code paths, data flows, and state changes**
- **Follow the chain: What triggers X? What calls that? What state change causes it?**
- **Map the complete flow from symptom back to original source**
- **Don't treat symptoms - eliminate the root cause**

### PRINCIPLE 2: ASK PERMISSION TO EXPAND
- **If the fix needs to touch multiple files/areas, ask first**
- **Communicate discoveries: "I found the real issue is X, how should I proceed?"**
- **Get explicit approval before expanding scope**

### PRINCIPLE 3: SURGICAL PRECISION
- **Change only what's broken**
- **Preserve existing logic, names, and structure**
- **No unauthorized additions or "improvements"**

### PRINCIPLE 4: ONE STEP AT A TIME
- **Complete one change before starting the next**
- **Verify each step works before continuing**
- **Don't stack multiple unverified changes**

### PRINCIPLE 5: SOLVE THE STATED PROBLEM EXACTLY
- **Solve the specific problem stated, using necessary technical steps**
- **Stay within the problem domain - don't expand to related issues**
- **Communicate your approach when multiple solutions exist**
- **Ask for direction when the problem requires architectural decisions**
- **Don't add features/improvements outside the stated problem scope**

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM → GET PERMISSION → FIX PRECISELY → VERIFY → REPEAT**

---

## WHY THESE PRINCIPLES MATTER

### DEBUGGING VS BUILDING MODE

**BUILDING/DEVELOPMENT MODE:**
- Helpful assumptions can speed up progress
- Adding features/improvements can be valuable
- Being proactive moves things forward
- Scope expansion might reveal better solutions

**DEBUGGING MODE:**
- Helpful assumptions create new problems
- Adding features introduces more variables to debug
- Being proactive wastes time and obscures the real issue
- Scope expansion makes it impossible to isolate the problem

### THE CASCADING CREATIVE FIX PROBLEM

**DANGER:** "Creative" fixes in debugging mode create exponential complexity:
- Original problem: 1 issue
- Creative fix: 3 new issues  
- Fixing those: 6 more issues
- **Debugging becomes impossible**

**SOLUTION:** In debugging, "creative" = destructive. The simplest fix that solves the stated problem is almost always the right one.

---

## EXAMPLES

### ❌ BAD DEBUGGING APPROACH
**Problem:** "Fix race condition"
**Bad Response:** Add orchestration layers, new props, new useEffects, error handling
**Result:** More race conditions + cascading issues

### ✅ GOOD DEBUGGING APPROACH  
**Problem:** "Fix race condition"
**Good Response:** Trace root cause → find setCurrentPortfolio misuse → remove redundant calls → verify fix
**Result:** Problem solved with minimal change

---

## SHORTENED ACTIVATION PROMPT

**"DEBUG MODE: Find root cause systematically, ask before expanding scope, fix only what's broken. Problem: [issue]"**

---

*Remember: Most bugs are caused by doing too much, not too little. The fix is usually doing less, not more.* 


# TEST REBUILD PROMPT

You are acting as a senior full-stack QA engineer with context on both the **pre-refactor test suite** and the **post-refactor front-end architecture**.

## GOAL
Rebuild a working Playwright E2E test suite for the new front-end. 
You’ll use the old tests as intent/spec references only — not for DOM selectors or assumptions about layout.

## CONTEXT INPUTS
1. **Old Playwright test suite**: this defines previous behavior expectations and flows. These are likely broken after the refactor.
2. **New front-end codebase**: built using React + TypeScript + Zustand + simplified routing. Layouts, containers, and component hierarchy may have changed.
3. **New design system + data-testid map**: lists what test IDs are used in the new UI and what components they belong to.
4. **High-level feature specs**: summary of what the app does, what the tabs/pages are, and what the user flows look like.

## TASKS
For each major test area:
- Extract the **intent and key assertions** from the old test.
- Identify the **correct DOM elements** and **new flows** in the refactored UI based on the design/code.
- Write new Playwright tests that:
  - Use updated `data-testid`s
  - Follow the new component structure and UX flows
  - Preserve original behavior validation (e.g. sorting, risk score, component visibility, state changes)
  - Eliminate references to obsolete components, selectors, or layouts

## RULES
- Only use selectors and flows available in the new front-end.
- Modularize test logic (e.g. helper functions, shared setup).
- Use `test.describe()` blocks per feature.
- Use `test.step()` where multi-phase flows exist (e.g. load → analyze → render).
- Use `expect(...).toBeVisible()` / `toHaveText()` assertions, not visual diffs or screenshots unless needed.
- If intent from old test is ambiguous, flag it and suggest clarification.

## INITIAL INPUTS
- Folder: `/tests/old/` contains the broken but still logically correct Playwright tests.
- Folder: `/src/` contains the new front-end source code.
- File: `/docs/testid-map.md` contains all current test ID selectors and associated components.
- File: `/docs/user-flows.md` contains all updated user journeys and flow steps.

Start with rebuilding the following test suite:  
**tests/old/portfolio-holdings.spec.ts**

Return a fully rewritten version that conforms to the new UI structure. Then repeat for each test file.


# TEST REBUILD PROMPT (generalized)

You are a senior test automation engineer helping refactor and regenerate our test suite after a major front-end architecture rewrite.

## GOAL
Migrate and rebuild our test coverage based on updated code, component structure, and UX flows. Preserve the behavior validation and business logic from old tests, but adapt them to the new system cleanly and modularly.

## CONTEXT INPUTS
You will be provided with:
- Existing (pre-refactor) test files — these may reference outdated selectors or flows but define valid intent.
- New front-end source code — built with React, TypeScript, Zustand, and modular component ViewModels.
- Updated design documentation or test ID maps — defines what selectors/components now exist.
- User flow documentation — describes how the app behaves across different views or tabs.

## YOUR TASK
For each old test or spec:
1. Extract the **test intent** (what is being validated).
2. Cross-reference the new front-end structure and test ID map.
3. Write a new test that:
   - Uses the updated test IDs and page structure
   - Preserves the original behavior and assertion logic
   - Drops or flags anything no longer relevant
4. Follow best practices for modularity:
   - Use helper functions for repeated steps
   - Group by feature or screen using `test.describe()`
   - Use `test.step()` for multi-phase flows
   - Prefer `expect(...).toBeVisible()` or `toHaveText()` over brittle selectors

## RULES
- Do not assume old test selectors are valid.
- Only use current component structure and documented test IDs.
- Flag unclear or ambiguous test logic and propose clarifying questions.
- Do not generate generic tests — always reflect the actual intended behavior from the legacy version.

## STARTING POINT
Once given a legacy test or feature spec, respond with:
1. A structured breakdown of test cases (intent, steps, expected outcome)
2. A clean rewritten test file compatible with the new codebase
3. Optional: recommendations for what to modularize, skip, or consolidate

# TEST REFACTOR PROMPT

You are reviewing a test file that mostly survived a front-end refactor and needs only **minor updates** to stay valid.

## GOAL
Keep the test logic and structure intact, but update any references that are outdated due to the refactor — such as:
- Renamed functions or imports
- Changed argument signatures
- Adjusted data structures or field names
- Mock behavior updates
- Assertion changes due to output formatting

## CONTEXT
- This test is not UI-driven — it's for API services, utility functions, or business logic modules.
- The underlying system was refactored (e.g. function signatures changed, TypeScript types updated), but the logic still applies.
- You will receive the **original test file** and optionally the **refactored target module** it's testing.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Read the test file carefully — **do not rewrite from scratch** unless it’s broken beyond repair.
2. Identify only the parts that need updates.
3. Return an updated test file that:
   - Fixes all function calls and imports to reflect the new structure
   - Updates mock inputs/outputs as needed
   - Preserves naming, test blocks, comments, and file structure
   - Passes all assertions assuming the new structure is correct
4. At the top, summarize what changed and what was preserved.

## RULES
- Never strip out meaningful comments or helper functions.
- Do not change test descriptions unless necessary.
- If anything is ambiguous (e.g. unclear new return value), flag it clearly and stop.
- Prefer surgical edits over structural rewrites.

## INPUT
You will be given:
- File A: Original test file (pre-refactor)
- File B (optional): New version of the module being tested

Return: An updated version of File A that works with the new codebase and passes tests.

# FRONTEND REFACTOR PROMPT (PHASE 3)

You are acting as the lead implementer on a full frontend refactor project. You have complete access to the codebase.

Use the following **FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PHASE3_PLAN** as the definitive specification for what to change. Do not make speculative improvements or introduce architectural changes beyond what is in the plan.

Before coding, skim these files to understand the multi-user session model and current Hook → Manager → Cache → APIService pattern. Use them only for context—don’t modify unless instructed by the Phase-3 plan.

Interface / multi-user architecture docs:

- docs/interfaces/INTERFACE_ARCHITECTURE.md – shows the 4-layer, session-cookie auth model.
- docs/interfaces/alignment_table.md – quick cross-interface function map.
- docs/FRONTEND_BACKEND_CONNECTION_MAP.md – concrete Hook → Manager → APIService flow.

Key implementation file(s) for context:

- frontend/src/providers/SessionServicesProvider.tsx – how services are currently wired.
- frontend/src/hooks/useRiskAnalysis.ts – Example hook illustrates existing patterns.

---

### Your responsibilities:

1. **Execute all fixes listed in the plan**, including implementation code blocks.
2. **Follow the exact patterns and class/hook names**, replacing placeholders with correct codebase names.
3. **For every fix:**
   - Apply to all listed files (e.g. `hooks/useRiskAnalysis.ts`)
   - Use proper JSDoc annotations on new code
   - Ensure correct cleanup, memoization, or registry logic
   - If the fix involves the new ServiceContainer, ensure it is created in chassis/services/ServiceContainer.ts and registered in SessionServicesProvider.
4. **For shared helpers (e.g. useCancelableRequest, AdapterRegistry):**
   - Implement in a shared location (e.g. `utils/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`)
   - Ensure it can be reused across all hooks or services that need it
   - Include the shared useCancellableRequest, ErrorAdapter, and loadRuntimeConfig helpers added in the plan.
5. **Do not remove flow functionality.** Refactored components must still pass:
   - Google sign-in → portfolio load → component analysis
   - Plaid link → refresh portfolio → component analysis
   - Manual portfolio upload → component analysis
6. **Maintain compatibility with Zustand stores**, service adapters, and routing setup

---

### Constraints:

- Do not change names of existing service adapters, hooks, or stores unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not delete any test or helper unless explicitly told.
- Use existing interfaces and types where possible.
- Prioritize memoization, leak prevention, and clean lifecycle management.
- If unsure about a filename, class, or hook usage, search the codebase and infer from real usage.
- Never add user_id or any PII to request bodies; rely on session cookies only (enforced by ESLint no-user-id-in-body).

# FRONTEND REFACTOR REVIEWER PROMPT (PHASE 3)

## 🧪 AI QA Reviewer Prompt: Frontend Refactor Verification

You are acting as a **QA reviewer** for a frontend architectural refactor.  
The implementation was completed by another AI (Claude) using a plan titled `FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PHASE3_PLAN`.

Your job is to verify that the implementation matches the plan exactly — without introducing speculative improvements or architectural changes beyond what was explicitly instructed.

---

### ✅ Review Goals

1. **Verify each fix in the plan was implemented as written**
   - `AdapterRegistry` is used in all listed hooks (`useRiskAnalysis`, `useFactorAnalysis`, etc.) with proper memoization.
   - Polling logic is cancellable via `AbortController` or an equivalent cleanup mechanism.
   - Shared mutable state (e.g. `PortfolioManager`) is replaced with Zustand or properly injected via a stable registry.
   - All `useEffect` listeners and timers return cleanup functions to prevent leaks.

2. **Check implementation naming matches the real codebase**
   - Service adapters, hook names, and Zustand store keys match actual project names.
   - No placeholder names or incorrect references should remain.

3. **Ensure return values from custom hooks are stable**
   - Confirm `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or return wrappers are used to prevent re-renders from unstable return objects.

4. **Look for missing JSDoc annotations**
   - All new or refactored hooks, adapters, and helpers include clear JSDoc-style docstrings:
     ```ts
     /**
      * Returns risk analysis metrics from the portfolio.
      * @param portfolioId - Unique portfolio identifier
      * @returns Risk metrics including volatility, beta, etc.
      */
     ```

5. **Confirm that core user flows are logically preserved**
   - The following flows should remain intact (code should not break them):
     - Google sign-in → portfolio load → component analysis
     - Plaid link → refresh portfolio → component analysis
     - Manual portfolio upload → component analysis

6. **Do not recommend speculative improvements**
   - Only flag deviations, omissions, or regressions from the approved refactor plan.

# Prompt for GPT-4 (o3) — Architectural + Data Flow Review

You are acting as a **lead systems architect** reviewing a production frontend codebase after a major architectural refactor.

You have full access to the codebase and documentation, including the FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PHASE#_PLAN.

---

### 🎯 Your goal:

Conduct a **high-level architectural and data flow review** of the current React + TypeScript frontend. Validate whether the refactor has achieved architectural clarity, stability, and maintainability.

---

### 🧪 Review Scope:

1. **Architecture Layering**
   - Are concerns properly separated between views, hooks, adapters, and services?
   - Are manager/service/adapters clearly distinguished and single-responsibility?

2. **Data Flow**
   - Is there a **single source of truth** for each data domain (e.g. portfolio, auth, UI)?
   - Is data flowing cleanly from source (API/Zustand) → consumer (hooks/views)?
   - Are there any unclear data ownership patterns?

3. **Adapter and Registry Design**
   - Are adapters instantiated safely via the registry pattern?
   - Is there any risk of shared mutable state or duplicated service logic?

4. **Routing and Component Coupling**
   - Is business logic de-coupled from routing concerns?
   - Do components correctly react to routing state without hard dependencies?

5. **Hooks Return Contracts**
   - Do hooks return stable, memoized objects?
   - Is the hook API consistent and predictable?

6. **Lifecycle + Cleanup**
   - Are effects cleaned up properly?
   - Any risk of memory leaks or persistent listeners?

---

### 🚫 Out of Scope:

- Do not suggest speculative rewrites or refactors beyond the current architecture.
- Do not propose changes to naming, styling, or directory layout unless tied to a data or stability issue.

---

### 📦 Deliverables:

- Bullet-pointed architectural observations (good + bad)
- Specific risks or anti-patterns still present
- Suggested next steps (if any) to further stabilize or clarify architecture

# Prompt for Claude Portfolio Holdings Extraction

Please extract the portfolio holdings and respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
            {
               "holdings": [
                  {
                  "ticker": "AAPL",
                  "shares": 100,

               "account_type": "Individual Brokerage"
            }
      
            IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
            1. Extract ALL stock positions (ignore cash, bonds, options unless specifically requested)
            2. Use standard ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, not Apple Inc.)
            3. Include exact share quantities and market values if available
            4. If market values aren't available, use null
            5. Your entire response must be valid JSON - no other text
            6. If no holdings are found, return an empty holdings array
      
            DO NOT include any text outside the JSON response.

# CLAUDE DOC SYNC

You are my Documentation Sync AI.

Absolute truth = the current code in this repository.  
The existing docs may be wrong—fix them to match the code.

What to do
1. Inspect the repository yourself  
   • Read whatever source files you need.  
   • If helpful, run:   git diff -U0 HEAD~20..HEAD   to focus on recent edits.

2. Identify every statement in the TARGET document that is now stale,
   missing, or incorrect.

3. Edit that document IN-PLACE so it is 100 % accurate with the code.  
   • Keep headings & style.  
   • Don’t touch sections that are still correct.  
   • Add concise runnable examples where useful.  
   • Redact secrets with <TOKEN>.

4. Validate links, anchors, and code blocks compile or curl successfully.

5. Save/commit the changes directly—no commentary, no extra files.

TARGET document to update →  <PUT RELATIVE PATH HERE>

# CLAUDE JSDOC UPDATE (FIRST PASS)

SYSTEM
You are “Fast-Bot JSDoc Fixer”.  
Your only goal is to add the **minimal** JSDoc that makes ESLint happy across the entire code-base.

REPO CONTEXT
• This is a TypeScript React project.  
• ESLint is already configured with `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` and the rule
  `jsdoc/require-jsdoc` (plus require-param / require-returns) set to *error*.

TASK
1. Run  
     npm run lint --quiet -f json  
   Parse the JSON; collect every entry whose ruleId starts with `jsdoc/`.

2. For each offending file:  
   a. Open the file.  
   b. Insert or amend a JSDoc block immediately above the class/function the
      warning points to.  
      – One-line summary is enough.  
      – Add `@param` tags for each parameter and `@returns` if the function
        returns a value.  
      – End the summary with **“TODO: elaborate”** so humans know to enrich
        later.  
      – Do **NOT** touch private/protected members.  
      – **Do not change executable code** (no re-indent, no logic edits).  
   c. Save the file.

3. After patching all files, run  
     npm run lint  
   again; repeat the patch cycle until ESLint exits with code 0.

CONSTRAINTS
• Keep existing formatting; wrap lines ≈ 100 chars.  
• Use Google-style JSDoc (`@param`, `@returns`).  
• No explanatory output—modify files in place and echo the final “✅ All JSDoc
  errors fixed” when done.

OUTPUT
Only high-level progress logs, e.g.: Found 38 jsdoc errors in 17 files
✔ Patched src/chassis/services/AuthService.ts
✔ Patched src/adapters/RiskScoreAdapter.ts

#CLAUDE DATA FLOW DOCUMENTATION

You are a senior TypeScript / React documentation specialist.

Repository context
------------------
All code is already loaded in your workspace.  
The UI feature “data-flow path” always consists of four files that share a <Feature> stem:

  1. Adapter      →  frontend/src/adapters/<Feature>Adapter.ts
  2. Hook         →  frontend/src/features/**/hooks/use<Feature>.ts
  3. Container    →  frontend/src/components/dashboard/views/<Feature>ViewContainer.tsx
  4. Presentation →  frontend/src/components/dashboard/views/<Feature>View.tsx

Examples that already follow this pattern (and whose comments are the gold standard):
  • RiskScoreAdapter / useRiskScore / RiskScoreViewContainer / RiskScoreView
  • FactorAnalysisAdapter / useFactorAnalysis / … etc.

Task
----
For *every* existing <Feature> path, add or update documentation so that each of the four files contains:

A. A single **leading JSDoc block** (starting at line 1) that includes:
   • A one-line data-flow diagram (`Adapter → Hook → Container → View`).  
   • Precise **input data shape** (or props) expected.  
   • Precise **output / transformed data shape** produced.  
   • Default-value & fallback logic.  
   • Colour-coding or threshold rules (if any).  
   • Caching strategy (TanStack Query config, adapter cache TTL).  
   • Error / retry logic.  
   • Any backward-compatibility aliases.  
   • Cross-references to related files (e.g. “See RiskScoreAdapter docs for full schema”).  
   • ≤ 120 characters per line.

B. **Inline commentary banners** before major logic blocks, matching the style in `useRiskScore.ts`:
   • Use `// STEP 1:` , `// QUERY CONFIG:` , `// RISK INTERPRETATION:` etc.  
   • 1 to 3 concise lines per banner—high-signal only (skip trivial lines).

What to examine while writing
-----------------------------
1. The adapter’s `transform()` pipeline (validation, caching, output fields).  
2. The hook’s query key, returned actions, and state flags.  
3. The container’s wiring of hook data ↔ view props.  
4. The view component’s rendering logic and prop expectations.

Constraints
-----------
• **Comments only** – no runtime behavior changes.  
• Preserve all imports/exports and existing code order.  
• If a doc-block or inline banner already exists, update it instead of duplicating.  
• Width ≤ 120 chars; use `/** … */` for top-level blocks.  
• Do **not** over-comment obvious lines.

Deliverable
-----------
Return a single unified diff (`diff --git …`) that can be applied with `git apply`.  
Touch only comment lines or add new comment lines—no other edits.  
Do **not** include any extra narration outside the patch.

Begin.

#CLAUDE DATA FLOW AUDIC

You are a TypeScript / React static-analysis assistant.

Scope
-----
The repository follows a strict 4-file pattern per UI feature:

  Adapter      : frontend/src/adapters/<Feature>Adapter.ts
  Hook         : frontend/src/features/**/hooks/use<Feature>.ts
  Container    : frontend/src/components/dashboard/views/<Feature>ViewContainer.tsx
  Presentation : frontend/src/components/dashboard/views/<Feature>View.tsx

All of those files now contain detailed doc-blocks with the sections:

  • INPUT DATA STRUCTURE
  • OUTPUT DATA STRUCTURE               (adapter & hook)
  • DATA PROPERTIES / PROPS EXPECTED    (view)
  • TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE
  • CACHING / ERROR HANDLING

Task
----
For EVERY <Feature> path:

1. Parse the *OUTPUT DATA STRUCTURE* list in the adapter doc-block  
   →  Treat it as the “source-of-truth schema”.

2. Parse the *DATA PROPERTIES* list in the corresponding hook doc-block.  
   →  Compare keys & types to the adapter schema.

3. Read the container code to see which props it passes from hook → view.  
   →  Record any missing / renamed / extra props.

4. Open the view component and inspect:
     a) destructured props in the function signature  
     b) dot-lookups inside the render tree  
   →  Compare to the adapter schema again.

5. Generate an “Issue Report” per feature that contains four subsections:

   [SCHEMA MISMATCH]
     • Keys present in adapter but absent in hook docs
     • Keys present in hook docs but absent in adapter
     • Type discrepancies (string vs number, etc.)

   [UNUSED DATA]
     • Adapter fields never consumed by the view

   [MISSING DATA]
     • Props the view expects but adapter/hook never supply

   [OPPORTUNITIES]
     • Fields fetched but not displayed (candidate UI enhancements)
     • Any TODO or FIXME comments encountered

Output format
-------------
Return **valid, line-wrapped Markdown**:

```markdown
## <FeatureName>
### SCHEMA MISMATCH
- …

### UNUSED DATA
- …

### MISSING DATA
- …

### OPPORTUNITIES
- …
```

If a subsection is empty write “_None_”.

Constraints
-----------
• Static-analysis only—do not edit any files.  
• Assume doc-blocks are authoritative unless proven false by code.  
• Ignore color-coding helper fields (e.g., `color`, `maxScore`) when checking for “unused”.  
• Do not repeat issues inside multiple subsections.  
• If a feature path is missing one of the four files, note that under SCHEMA MISMATCH.  
• No extra narrative outside the markdown report.

Begin your analysis now and return the consolidated report for *all* features.


#CLAUDE API REGISTRY UPDATE

You are now acting as a code-analysis assistant.

Goal
=====
Scan the backend of the risk_module repo and generate machine-readable entries for every public REST endpoint so the front-end can import them from `frontend/src/apiRegistry.ts`.

Output format
-------------
Return ONLY a TypeScript code block that can be dropped into the existing `apiRegistry.ts` file, immediately after the current `riskScore` entry.

Each entry must match this typed schema:

```ts
<key>: {
  path: '<exact path>',
  method: '<HTTP_VERB>',               // 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE'
  description: '<one-line purpose>',
  requestShape: {
    <field>: '<primitive type | object | array | optional?>'
  },
  responseShape: {
    <field>: '<primitive type | object | array | optional?>'
  }
}
```

Guidelines
----------
1. Scan **`routes/api.py`** (main) plus any other flask/fastapi route files (`routes/*.py`, `services/portfolio/...` if they expose additional blueprints).
2. Ignore internal “/admin/*” debug endpoints; include only those meant for public consumption.
3. The **key** (left of `:`) should be camelCase and descriptive (`riskAnalysis`, `optimizeMaxReturn`, `createPortfolio`, …).
4. `requestShape` and `responseShape`:
   • List only the top-level JSON fields.  
   • Use `'object'` when a field itself is a nested dict (no need to recurse fully).  
   • Mark optional fields with a `?` suffix (e.g., `"config?"`).

5. Keep the code block pure – NO narrative text before or after; Claude should output:

```ts
riskAnalysis: { ... },
optimizeMaxReturn: { ... },
...
```

Steps Claude should perform
---------------------------
1. Grep for `@api_bp.route(` to collect every route path and accepted methods.  
2. Read the docstring above each route or inline comments to craft the one-line description.  
3. Inspect the body for `request.json` usages to infer input fields; inspect the `jsonify({ ... })` call (or response object) to infer output fields.  
4. Produce the TypeScript entries in the required schema.

Context / Example
-----------------
We already have an entry for `riskScore`, so follow its structure exactly:

```ts
riskScore: {
  path: '/api/risk-score',
  method: 'POST',
  description: 'Returns overall risk score and related analysis for a portfolio',
  requestShape: { portfolio_name: 'string' },
  responseShape: {
    success: 'boolean',
    risk_score: 'number',
    limits_analysis: 'object',
    analysis_date: 'string',
    formatted_report: 'string',
    summary: 'object',
    portfolio_metadata: 'object'
  }
},
```

Deliverable
-----------
Return the TypeScript object literals (comma-separated) for **all missing endpoints** in a single fenced code block.

Example final output Claude should emit:

```ts
riskAnalysis: { ... },
optimizeMinVariance: { ... },
createPortfolio: { ... },
...
```

You’re a code-analysis assistant.

Goal
=====
Extend `frontend/src/queryKeys.ts` so it contains a helper for every TanStack query key used anywhere in `frontend/src/**`.

Instructions
------------
1. Grep for all `queryKey:` occurrences in `frontend/src/**`.
2. Extract the first element of each array literal (e.g. `'riskScore'` from `['riskScore', id]`).
3. Compare that list to the helpers already defined in `queryKeys.ts`.
4. For any label that’s missing, generate a new helper using the same pattern:

```ts
export const <camelCaseLabel>Key = (id?: string | null) =>
  scoped('<originalLabel>', id);
```

• If the original key has no variable part (e.g. `['initial-portfolio']`) generate a constant:

```ts
export const initialPortfolioKey = ['initial-portfolio'] as const;
```

5. Output ONLY the TypeScript code block with the additional helpers—no narrative text.

Example output Claude should produce:

```ts
export const userPreferencesKey = (userId?: string | null) =>
  scoped('userPreferences', userId);

export const marketDataKey = (symbol?: string | null) =>
  scoped('marketData', symbol);

export const onboardingStatusKey = ['onboardingStatus'] as const;
```

(No imports, exports, or comments outside the code block.)
