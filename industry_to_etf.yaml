# Industry to ETF Mapping Configuration
# 
# PRIMARY PURPOSE: Industry ETF Proxy Mappings for Factor Analysis
# ===============================================================
# This file provides industry-to-ETF proxy mappings used primarily for:
# 1. **Factor Analysis**: Maps industries to representative ETFs for risk modeling
# 2. **Asset Class Classification**: Tier 3 of the 5-tier classification system
# 3. **Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Industry exposure calculations via proxy ETFs
#
# MAIN USAGE: Industry ETF Proxies
# ===============================
# The primary use case is mapping company industries to representative ETFs:
# - Technology companies → XLK (Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund)
# - Healthcare companies → XLV (Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund)  
# - Financial companies → XLF (Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund)
# - REITs → VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF) + real_estate classification
# - Gold mining → GLD (SPDR Gold Shares) + commodity classification
#
# This enables factor regression analysis: 
# Stock_Return = α + β₁*Market + β₂*Momentum + β₃*Value + β₄*Industry_ETF + ε
#
# INTEGRATION WITH ASSET CLASS SYSTEM:
# ===================================
# Tier 1: Cash Proxy           → Direct cash detection
# Tier 2: Database Cache       → Cached asset class results  
# Tier 3: FMP Industry         → DATABASE industry_proxies table (this file as backup)
# Tier 4: Security Type        → Basic type-based mapping (equity → equity)
# Tier 5: AI Fallback          → GPT analysis for complex cases
#
# USAGE IN CODE:
# =============
# **Primary Usage - Factor Analysis:**
# - proxy_builder.load_industry_etf_map() (loads from industry_proxies database table)
# - DatabaseClient.get_industry_mappings() (retrieves 175 mappings from database)
# - proxy_builder.map_industry_etf() (gets ETF proxy for industry)
# - Factor regression models use these ETFs as industry exposure proxies
# - Risk analysis calculates portfolio industry exposures via proxy ETFs
#
# CORE SECTOR ETFs (matches database bootstrap)
# ============================================
# Keep these high-level sectors in YAML so database + YAML stay aligned.
# They mirror the seed rows inserted into industry_proxies via schema.sql.

# **Secondary Usage - Asset Classification:**
# - SecurityTypeService._classify_asset_class_from_fmp_industry() (Tier 3)
# - proxy_builder.map_industry_asset_class() (uses database asset_class overrides)
#
# **Development Usage - YAML Source of Truth:**
# - Edit this file for new mappings (easier than database commands)
# - Upload changes to database when ready for production
# - Serves as configuration source and emergency fallback
#
# DATABASE SYNCHRONIZATION:
# ========================
# This file follows the 3-tier architecture pattern:
# 1. DATABASE (Primary): industry_proxies table - live production data (175 mappings)
# 2. YAML (Source of Truth): This file - configuration management and development
# 3. HARDCODED (Ultimate): Built-in mappings in proxy_builder.py
#
# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
# ====================
# 1. **Edit YAML**: Modify this file for new mappings or changes (easier to work with)
# 2. **Upload to Database**: Sync changes to production database when ready
# 3. **Production Use**: Database serves all runtime requests
#
# CURRENT STATUS: Database is PRIMARY for runtime, YAML is SOURCE OF TRUTH for config
# - industry_proxies table: 175 rows with ETF mappings + 24 asset_class overrides
# - This YAML file: Configuration source and development workspace
# - Database includes asset_class column for real_estate, commodity, bond, crypto overrides
#
# To manage via admin tools:
#   python admin/manage_reference_data.py industry list
#   python admin/manage_reference_data.py industry add [industry] [etf]
#   # Or edit this YAML file directly and re-upload to database
#
# MAPPING FORMATS:
# ===============
# Simple format (ETF only):
#   Industry Name: ETF_TICKER
#
# Extended format (ETF + asset class override + optional sector group):
#   Industry Name:
#     etf: ETF_TICKER
#     asset_class: ASSET_CLASS
#     group: SECTOR_GROUP
#
# ASSET CLASS OVERRIDES:
# =====================
# The asset_class field overrides the default equity classification.
# This is crucial for industries that should map to different asset classes:
# - REITs → real_estate (not equity)
# - Commodity industries → commodity (not equity)  
# - Financial services → varies based on business model
#
# EXAMPLES:
# ========
# **Primary Use - Industry ETF Proxies:**
# Technology: XLK                    # Tech companies use XLK as industry proxy ETF
# Healthcare: XLV                    # Healthcare companies use XLV as industry proxy ETF
# 
# **Extended Use - ETF Proxy + Asset Class Override:**
# Gold:                              # Gold mining companies:
#   etf: GLD                         #   - Use GLD as industry proxy ETF  
#   asset_class: commodity           #   - Override asset class to commodity (not equity)
#   group: defensive                 #   - Optional sector group bucket (defensive / cyclical / sensitive)
#
# Real Estate Investment Trusts:     # REITs:
#   etf: VNQ                         #   - Use VNQ as industry proxy ETF
#   asset_class: real_estate         #   - Override asset class to real_estate (not equity)
#   group: defensive
