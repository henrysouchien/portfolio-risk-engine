    """
    Uses GPT to generate a peer group of subindustry tickers for a given stock.

    Given a stock's ticker, name, and industry, this function sends a structured
    prompt to the OpenAI ChatCompletion API and expects a response in the form of 
    a Python list of tickers (strings). The peers are intended to reflect companies 
    with similar business models or competitive positioning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ticker : str
        The stock symbol to generate peers for (e.g., "NVDA").
    name : str
        The full company name (e.g., "NVIDIA Corporation").
    industry : str
        Broad industry classification (e.g., "Semiconductors").
    model : str, default="gpt-4.1"
        The OpenAI chat model to use.
    max_tokens : int, default=200
        Max token count for the GPT response.
    temperature : float, default=0.2
        Sampling temperature (lower → more deterministic).

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The raw GPT response content as a string (still needs `ast.literal_eval()` parsing).
        Returns an empty string on error or if the model response is malformed.

    Notes
    -----
    • This function does **not** parse the GPT output into a Python list. That is handled downstream.
    • The model is instructed to return only a Python list of valid, public tickers from the U.S., U.K., or Canada.
    • Failures (API issues, unexpected formats) return an empty string and print full stack trace.

    Example Output
    --------------
    '["AMD", "INTC", "AVGO", "QCOM", "TSM", "MRVL", "TXN"]'
    """
    prompt = f"""
You’re a fundamental equity analyst.
Given the following stock details, return 5–10 peer tickers that best
represent its subindustry or closest competitive group — ideally companies
that compete with or operate in similar business models.

Only include **currently publicly listed** equities from the U.S., Canada,
or U.K.  

Do not include companies that have been acquired, merged, or
delisted.  

Return a clean list of tickers, no explanation.

Security: {ticker}
Company: {company_name}
Description: {description}

Focus on the investment exposure, not the legal structure. For example:
- A bond fund should be classified as "bond"
- A REIT or real estate fund should be classified as "real_estate" 
- A mining company or fund (gold, silver, copper, etc.) should be classified as "commodity"
- A cryptocurrency fund or crypto-themed ETF should be classified as "crypto"
- A regular stock should be classified as "equity"
- A money market or ultra-short-term bond fund should be classified as "cash"
- A multi-asset fund should be classified as "mixed"
- If unclear or insufficient information, use "unknown"

Respond in this exact format: "asset_class,confidence_score"
Where confidence_score is between 0.00 and 1.00

Examples:
- "bond,0.95" for a bond fund
- "equity,0.85" for a regular stock
- "real_estate,0.90" for a REIT or real estate fund
- "commodity,0.80" for a mining company or mining fund
- "crypto,0.90" for a cryptocurrency fund or crypto-themed ETF
- "cash,0.95" for a money market or ultra-short-term bond fund
- "mixed,0.75" for a target-date fund
- "unknown,0.30" if insufficient information
